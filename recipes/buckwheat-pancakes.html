        <h2>Description</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/4 cups (295 ml) milk, dairy and non-dairy both will work</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar or fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for skillet</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (187 grams) buckwheat flour (or use 50-50 blend of buckwheat and all-purpose flour)</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a 2-cup measuring jug or bowl, stir the milk and vinegar (or lemon juice) together, and then set aside for five minutes. (This mixture mimics buttermilk, which when mixed with the baking soda later in the recipe, makes the pancakes fluffy.)</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, whisk the flours, sugar, baking soda, and the salt in a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Whisk the egg and vanilla into the milk.</li>
                <li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour the milk mixture and melted butter into the well and use a fork to stir until you no longer see clumps of flour. It is okay if the batter has a few small lumps â€“ it is important not to over-mix the batter.</li>
                <li>Heat a large skillet (or use a griddle) over medium heat. The pan is ready if when you splatter a little water onto the pan surface, the water dances around the pan and eventually evaporates.</li>
                <li>Lightly brush the skillet with melted butter. Use a 1/4-cup measuring cup to spoon batter onto skillet. Gently spread the batter into a 4-inch circle.</li>
                <li>When the edges look dry, and bubbles start to appear and pop on the top surface of the pancake, turn over. This takes about 2 minutes. Once flipped, cook another 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned and cooked in the middle. Serve immediately with warm syrup, butter, and your favorite pancake toppings.</li>
            </ol>
