        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>For the choux bun</p>
            <ul>

                <li>60 g Water</li>
                <li>60 g Whole milk</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon Salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Granulated sugar</li>
                <li>70 g Bread flour high protein content flour, eg. 13%</li>

            <p>Metric – US Customary</p> 
            <p>US customary cup measurement is an indicative figure only. Measure the ingredients with a digital scale by weight (gram). Baking is art but also science which requires precision and accuracy.</p>
        
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Sift flour then measure and set aside.</li>
                <li>Place butter, water, milk, salt and sugar into a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>As soon as the mixture starts to boil, remove from heat, add the flour in one go and whisk vigorously with a rubber spatula until it forms one smooth ball and flour bits are not visible.</li>
                <li>Place the saucepan back on the stove and cook the dough for 3-5 min over medium heat mixing constantly. There should be a thin skin formed on the bottom of the saucepan.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough into a bowl and let it cool down slightly before mixing the egg in. Only add a small amount of egg at a time, consistently whisking after each addition. You should reach a consistency which is not too runny, not too firm but just fine to pipe. The exact quantity of egg will need your judgement.</li>
                <li>With a French star nozzle tip pipe 6 equal size eclairs on a baking mat leaving enough space in between them as they will puff. Optionally dust with icing sugar, that also helps to avoid cracks. Place the tray into the freezer for 30 min at least.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 200 C / 392 F (no fan).</li>
                <li>Lower oven temperature to 170 C / 338 F (no fan) and bake the eclairs for 40 min. Do not open the oven door in the first 30 min. If you are baking it the first time it is a good idea to take one eclair out of the oven at 40 min and check its consistency. If it is golden in colour, nicely puffed up, does not deflate at room temperature and the middle of the eclair is not raw (it is ok if it's a bit wet, it will dry while cooling down) then it is considered to be done.</li>
                <li>Cool either on the perforated air mat or if baked on parchment then cool them on a cooling rack.</li>
                <li>Fill with any pastry cream of your choice.</li>
            </ol>
